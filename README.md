# Dimensions

A cool little application that utilizes Google's advanced image processing API's to retrieve the exact address of a particular provided image. To further the fun, this application then uses image descriptors to generate an AI art image, as if the image was in an alternate *dimension* (uses OpenAI's DALL E 2 API).

## Description

**Technologies Used - (Purpose)**
SASS - styles
MongoDB Atlas- database to persist image links and image descriptors
Cloudinary - image upload and storage
Google Places API - address determination
Google Vision API - image information extraction (labels)
Open AI DALLE2 API - AI art generator
